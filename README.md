# ultravioletv2

why hello ther this is me (the owner creating this) because my friends wanted me too, if I don't know who you are you (I think are still fre to use it) I guess. Anyways this is basically a browser to unblock things whether you are at a school that blocks certain websites to keep you on task or some other reasons

faq:
1- I did not create this and I think it runs off of my PC but I'm not sure so I guess I am testing it

2- I did not create this I used a program called "HTTrack (https://www.httrack.com)"

3- this program is free for now

4- this website that "is mirrored" os also not mine it is called ultraviolet and is also downloadable on github (https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) the webist I used idk how did it but they made it so you can access it without having to download anything so yea (https://thewhite.site)
